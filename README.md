# 🇿🇲 Nthanda Monetization App - MVP

**Help creators in Zambia get paid reliably.**

A web-based creator monetization platform enabling fast, reliable mobile-money-based payments. Fans support creators using local payment methods, creators receive payouts to mobile money accounts.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Creators in Zambia lack reliable monetization tools because most global platforms don't support local payments. This forces creators to rely on foreign accounts, middlemen, or unsustainable partnerships. **Nthanda solves this by enabling direct mobile-money payments.**

---

## 📋 MVP Scope (2 Weeks)

**Core User Flows:**
- ✅ Creators sign up, create profiles, set up bank accounts
- ✅ Fans discover creators, send payments via mobile money
- ✅ Creators see balances, request payouts
- ✅ Admin approves payouts, reconciles transactions

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React (modern UI, mobile-responsive)
- **Backend:** Django REST Framework or Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (immutable ledger)
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis
- **Auth:** JWT tokens
- **Payments:** Local mobile money provider APIs
- **Hosting:** Cloud VPS (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)

## 🔗 Daily Workflow

### Before Code
1. **Create Issue** - Use appropriate template (backend, frontend, integration, etc.)
2. **Define API Contract** - Backend & frontend agree on request/response
3. **Assign Owner** - Clear ownership
4. **Link Dependencies** - Track blockers

### During Code
1. **Implement Feature** - Follow acceptance criteria
2. **Test Locally** - Unit + integration tests
3. **Request Review** - Code review before merge
4. **Merge to Main** - Squash commits

### Daily Sync (Days 3-10)
1. **Backend-Frontend Handshake** - 15 min standup
2. **Verify Real Endpoints** - Frontend uses actual API (no mocks)
3. **Log Blockers** - Same day resolution
4. **Integration Owner Sign-Off** - API contracts approved

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

Feature is **Done** when:
- ✅ Code meets acceptance criteria
- ✅ Tests written (unit + integration)
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Real backend integration (no mocks)
- ✅ QA verified on mobile & desktop
- ✅ Integration owner approved
- ✅ Merged to main

---
