- [ ] Business logic / service layer
- [ ] Webhook handler
- [ ] Authentication / authorization
- [ ] Error handling & validation
- [ ] Logging & monitoring

## 🔗 API Endpoint(s)
List endpoints being created/updated:
```
METHOD /api/v1/path
METHOD /api/v1/path2
```

## 📡 Request & Response Contract
**Request Body:**

- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Webhook / callback idempotency (if applicable)
- [ ] Database migrations run without errors
- [ ] Logging captures key operations (for debugging)

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Manual API testing (e.g., Postman / curl)
- [ ] Edge cases tested (empty data, invalid IDs, etc.)
- [ ] Error cases tested (401, 400, 500 responses)

## 📊 Performance
- [ ] Query performance acceptable (< 500ms)
- [ ] Batch operations optimized (avoid N+1 queries)
- [ ] Database indexes in place if needed

## 🔐 Security
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] SQL injection protected (using ORM/parameterized queries)
