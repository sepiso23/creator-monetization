## 📌 Task Summary
Describe the DevOps or infrastructure task.

## 🎯 Scope
- [ ] Environment setup (dev / staging / production)
- [ ] Database setup & migrations
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Secret / environment variable management
- [ ] Monitoring & logging setup
- [ ] Backup & recovery procedures
- [ ] Load balancing & scaling
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] API rate limiting & security headers
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Analytics / usage monitoring
- [ ] Database replication / failover

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All code merged and tested on staging
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Environment variables configured (don't commit secrets)
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Backup system tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Verification step (smoke test)

## 🔧 Configuration
**Environment Variables Required:**
```
BACKEND_URL=
DATABASE_URL=
REDIS_URL=
MOBILE_MONEY_API_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
```

**Database Migrations:**
List migration files to be applied:
- migration_file_1.sql
- migration_file_2.sql

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] All API endpoints responding (200 OK)
- [ ] Database queries executing correctly
- [ ] Logs flowing to monitoring system
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested
- [ ] No error spike in monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Users can complete key flows (login, payment, payout)

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerts
**Key Metrics:**
- API response time (target < 500ms)
- Error rate (target < 0.1%)
- Database connection pool health
- Redis cache hit rate

**Alerts Configured:**
- [ ] High error rate (> 1%)
- [ ] API response time > 2s
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Memory/disk usage critical

## 🔒 Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] CORS headers configured correctly
- [ ] API keys rotated recently
- [ ] Database backups encrypted

## 🔙 Rollback Plan
If deployment fails, how do we rollback?
- Previous version location
- Database rollback procedure
- Communication plan

## 📞 Support / Escalation
- **On-call contact:** 
- **Escalation path:**
- **Support hours:**
